Flags:
FirstCrazyDomme -> Not existing if first time running CR\BackgroundMode\StartUp\CrazyDommeMode.txt, otherwise skips setup of crazy domme mode and goes to loading crazy domme mode normally
FirstMood -> Not existing if first time running CR\BackgroundMode\StartUp\GNMSetMood.txt, otherwise skips first time mood setup
Day(x)Good/Bad -> Defines whether a day in the month has been good or bad, switches based on mood if that day occurs. First time setup in CR\BackgroundMode\StartUp\GNMBackgroundStartUpFirst.txt
and updated in CR\End\RunEndDayCheck.txt

Variables:
DevotionSet -> Amount of minutes a session should last
OTime -> Variable that is compared to OTimeSet in some occassions to cause a definite orgasm/ruin. After that it is reset. 
OTimeSet -> OTimeSet depends on denial level and is set in Vocabulary/#DenialLevel
Short/Medium/LongSession -> Determines how dome undresses throughout the tease, explained here: CR\Settings\DevotionSet.txt

#WORKS: Does calling variables like #MeritChangeNHigh really executed the whole script?
#WORKS: Does this work? "@NullResponse #DenialLevel @CallReturn(CR\End\Decide\DecideORStandard.txt)"


Notes about scripting:
@Flag / @NotFlag checks for a flag and supports multiple flags at once @Flag(test, test2) @Goto(flagsAreTrue)
@FlagOr continues of one of the flags exist @FlagOr(test1, test2, test3)
Behaviour with vocab files: Picked randomly between all lines that are "true"/valid (flag checks etc.)
@SetDate can be in one line multiple times
#DateDifference(Date, Seconds) can only be once in a line otherwise vocab error
#Vocab can also be used after nullresponse and does not require any output
