Notes about scripting:
@Flag / @NotFlag checks for a flag and supports multiple flags at once @Flag(test, test2) @Goto(flagsAreTrue)
@FlagOr continues of one of the flags exist @FlagOr(test1, test2, test3)
Behaviour with vocab files: Picked randomly between all lines that are "true"/valid (flag checks etc.)
@SetDate can be in one line multiple times
#DateDifference(Date, Seconds) can only be once in a line otherwise vocab error
#Vocab can also be used after nullresponse and does not require any output
You can use vocabs in vocabfiles
You can only use ChangeVar when using another variable in the equation (can be used to create new vars though) Example: @ChangeVar[Test]=[Test1]*[2]
You can only use SetVar when assigning just a value and no equation is present Example: @SetVar[Test]=[0]
@CustomMode(done, Goto, Continue2) @Wait(999999) goes to when a message contains done is written. "Done Mistress", or just "done" for example.
