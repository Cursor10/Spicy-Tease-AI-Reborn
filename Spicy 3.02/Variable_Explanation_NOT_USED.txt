#WORKS: Does calling variables like #MeritChangeNHigh really executed the whole script?
#WORKS: Does this work? "@NullResponse #DenialLevel @CallReturn(CR\End\Decide\DecideORStandard.txt)"
#WORKS: @Variable[#DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)]>[1] @NullResponse @ChangeVar[OTime]=[OTime]+[#Random(1,10)] @Goto(test)

#TODO: Punishment with chastity does not properly put on chastity, search for HasChastity
#TODO: Add the fixed you aren't allowed to talk thing

Notes about scripting:
@Flag / @NotFlag checks for a flag and supports multiple flags at once @Flag(test, test2) @Goto(flagsAreTrue)
@FlagOr continues of one of the flags exist @FlagOr(test1, test2, test3)
@SetFlag/@DeleteFlag Supports multiple flags at once
Behaviour with vocab files: Picked randomly between all lines that are "true"/valid (flag checks etc.)
@SetDate can be in one line multiple times
#DateDifference(Date, Seconds) can only be once in a line otherwise vocab error
@NullResponse @Variable[GNMMerits]>[1000] @SetVar[GNMMerits]=[1000] works. No need for @Variable[GNMMerits]>[1000] @NullResponse @SetVar[GNMMerits]=[1000]
@ShowVar[#DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)] does not work! Just use #DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)
#Vocab can also be used after nullresponse and does not require any output
You can use vocabs in vocabfiles
You can only use ChangeVar when using another variable in the equation (can be used to create new vars though) Example: @ChangeVar[Test]=[Test1]*[2]
You can only use SetVar when assigning just a value and no equation is present Example: @SetVar[Test]=[0]
@CustomMode(done, Goto, Continue2) @Wait(999999) goes to when a message contains done is written. "Done Mistress", or just "done" for example.
@RapidCodeOn works infront of normal messages to make them display instantly. However it does NOT work with answers: [slut] @RapidCodeOn okay @Goto(test)

Important Setup:
All tagged sets must contain at least one picture with each tag (fully dressed, halfdressed etc.)
Session length from 600 - 1200 and no domme decide based on level! Restart tease ai every 600 minutes!
