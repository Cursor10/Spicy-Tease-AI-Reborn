#WORKS: Does calling variables like #MeritChangeNHigh really executed the whole script?
#WORKS: Does this work? "@NullResponse #DenialLevel @CallReturn(CR\End\Decide\DecideORStandard.txt)"
#WORKS: @Variable[#DateDifference(TeaseSession, Seconds)]>[1] @NullResponse @ChangeVar[OTime]=[OTime]+[#Random(1,10)] @Goto(test)
#TODO: Implement responses properly
#TODO: Add tasks Custom\Tasks_NOT_USED
#TODO: Add challenges Custom\Miniscripts\Challenge_NOT_USED
#TODO: Finish sub birthday Interrupt\SpecialDays\SubBirthday.txt


Notes about scripting:
@Flag / @NotFlag checks for a flag and supports multiple flags at once @Flag(test, test2) @Goto(flagsAreTrue)
@FlagOr continues of one of the flags exist @FlagOr(test1, test2, test3)
Behaviour with vocab files: Picked randomly between all lines that are "true"/valid (flag checks etc.)
@SetDate can be in one line multiple times
#DateDifference(Date, Seconds) can only be once in a line otherwise vocab error
#Vocab can also be used after nullresponse and does not require any output
